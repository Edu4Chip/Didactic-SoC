# Kactus2 + IPXACT

These are brief instructions for using kactus2.

## IPXACT standard

IPXACT is standard for IPs, their interface, connectivity and memory map. They do not contain any behavioral data.

## Standard version

This repository IPXACT is latest standard (1685-2022, in short, referred as 22 standard). This requires Kactus2 to be sufficiently new version. It is highly recommended to have most up-to-date release version.

You can also see the [kactus2dev](https://github.com/kactus2/kactus2dev/) repository for lasts updates.

## Kactus2 briefly

IPXACT packaged modules are placed and connected in hardware diagrams to create full SoCs. Structural RTL is generated based on these diagrams. Hierarchical designs can be further used to generate supportive items such as soc address headers, Renode platform files and documentation.
