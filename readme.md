# Didactic SoC

This is the common chip template for the Edu4chip project. It is created with IPXACT modeling using the Kactus2 tool. Source files are reused from both open source and previous projects. This project is licensed under the terms of the Solderpad Hardware License v2.1.

See Doc Folder for more extensive documentation and guides as well as contribution guidelines (to be written).

## Get started

This repository uses Bender, install instructions [here](https://github.com/pulp-platform/bender).

After cloning this repository, run `make repository_init` to fetch all of the submodules to correct versions.

## Basic simulation flow

baremetal program run on IBEX CPU has been abstracted to `make test_all TESTCASE=blink` command.

This will build HW libraries (`Questa`), executable binary (`riscv-toolchain`), convert binary to hexfile (`elf2hex`) and finally run the simulator (`Questa`). testcase targets folder with sw folder and expects it to be named with same name

## Folders

Doc: Full documentation is gathered within doc folder.

ips: open source IP are added to this folders as git submodules. We prefer to have all of the modules up to latest versions, but this is confirmed case by case when we are ready to run simulations/synthesis.

ipxact: XML files of IPXACT definitions are kept within this folder.

sim: Simulation Makefiles and scripts are kept in this folder. Additionally, supporting files for waveform generation can be added here. 

* All tool scripts need to include capability of targeting filelists with `relative path` from filelist to file and `# symbol for comments`. `Empty lines` must be okay, too. 

src: RTL source files are added to this folder in relevant subfolders. In addition, filelists for SoC compilation are kept here. If your RTL is not publicly available, create a tieoff module to allow others to proceed with their work. (Tieoff: interface .sv/.v/.vhd with all outputs being driven with inactive constants, genrally 0's.)

sw: baremetal programs and their flow.

syn: Synthesis Makefiles and commands. Same as with sim folder.

Verification: Contains experimental verilator verification setup.

## What is currently missing

* simulation flow currently only supports .v / .sv files.

* SW common functions are missing (eg. `print_with_uart("message");` -style commands).

* irq support for baremetal c programs. `crt0.S` implementation is minimal (WIP).

* tool commands for syn / nandgate. These estimations could be useful early.

* Documentation is incomplete. Once complete, it should contain details why certain template architecture was chosen as well as more extensive documentation what is included where. Additionally, template documentation should be added for "student" systems to document themselves.

* pcb related items such as external clock frequency, connetivity.

## What is excluded from repository

* tool outputs: tools should create build folder for their output. None of this folder content should be part of the git repository. IF need be, provide documentation how to run tools to get the same output.
