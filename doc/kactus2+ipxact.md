# Kactus2 + IP-XACT

These are brief instructions for using Kactus2.

## IP-XACT standard

IP-XACT is standard for IPs, their interface, connectivity and memory map. They do not contain any behavioral data.

## Standard version

This repository IP-XACT is latest standard (1685-2022, in short, referred as 22 standard). This requires Kactus2 to be sufficiently new version. It is highly recommended to have most up-to-date release version.

You can also see the [kactus2dev](https://github.com/kactus2/kactus2dev/) repository for the most recent updates.

## Kactus2 briefly

IP-XACT packaged modules are placed and connected in hardware diagrams to create full SoCs. Structural RTL is generated based on these diagrams. Hierarchical designs can be further used to generate supportive items such as soc address headers, Renode platform files and documentation.
